# Notable rationale of wazero

## wazeroir
wazero's intermediate representation (IR) is called `wazeroir`. Compiling into an IR provides us a faster interpreter
and a building block for a future JIT compilation engine. Both of these help answer demands for a more performant
runtime vs interpreting Wasm directly (the `naivevm` interpreter).

### Intermediate Representation (IR) design
`wazeroir`'s initial design borrowed heavily from the defunct `microwasm` format (a.k.a. LightbeamIR). Notably,
`wazeroir` doesn't have block operations: this simplifies the implementation.

Note: `microwasm` was never specified formally, and only exists in a historical codebase of wasmtime:

## Implementation limitations

WebAssembly 1.0 (MVP) specification allows runtimes to [limit certain aspects of Wasm module or execution](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#a2-implementation-limitations).

wazero limitations are imposed pragmatically and described below.

### Number of functions in a store

The possible number of function instances in [a store](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#store%E2%91%A0) is not specified in the WebAssembly specifications since [`funcaddr`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#syntax-funcaddr) corresponding to a function instance can be arbitrary number. 
wazero limits the maximum function instances to 2^27 as even that number would occupy 1GB in function pointers.

That is because not only we _believe_ that all use cases are fine with the limitation, but also we have no way to test wazero runtimes under these unusual circumstances.

### Number of function types in a store

There's no limitation on the number of function types in [a store](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#store%E2%91%A0) according to the spec. In wazero implementation, we assign each function type to a unique ID, and choose to use `uint32` to represent the IDs.
Therefore the maximum number of function types a store can have is limited to 2^27 as even that number would occupy 512MB just to reference the function types.

This is due to the same reason for the limitation on the number of functions above.

### Number of values on the stack in a function

While the the spec does not clarify a limitation of function stack values, wazero limits this to 2^27 = 134,217,728.
The reason is that we internally represent all the values as 64-bit integers regardless of its types (including f32, f64), and 2^27 values means 
1 GiB = (2^30). 1 GiB is the reasonable for most applications [as we see a Goroutine has 250 MB as a limit on the stack for 32-bit arch](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/f296b7a6f045325a230f77e9bda1470b1270f817/src/runtime/proc.go#L120), considering that WebAssembly is (currently) 32-bit environment.

All the functions are statically analyzed at module instantiation phase, and if a function can potentially reach this limit, an error is returned.

### Number of globals in a module

Theoretically, a module can declare globals (including imports) up to 2^32 times. However, wazero limits this to  2^27(134,217,728) per module.
That is because internally we store globals in a slice with pointer types (meaning 8 bytes on 64-bit platforms), and therefore 2^27 globals
means that we have 1 GiB size of slice which seems large enough for most applications.
