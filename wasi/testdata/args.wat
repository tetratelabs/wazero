;; This is a wat file to just export args WASI API to the host environment for testing the APIs.
;; This is currently separated as a wat file and pre-compiled because our text parser doesn't
;; implement 'memory' yet. After it supports 'memory', we can remove this file and embed this
;; wat file in the Go test code.
;;
;; Note: Although this is a raw wat file which should be moved under /tests/wasi in principle,
;; this file is put here for now, because this is a temporary file until the parser supports
;; the enough syntax, and this file will be embedded in unit test codes after that.
