- `engine` contains variety of e2e tests, mainly to ensure the consistency in the behavior between engines.
- `codec` contains a test and benchmark on text and binary decoders.
- `spectest` contains end-to-end tests with the [WebAssembly specification tests](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/wg-1.0/test/core).
