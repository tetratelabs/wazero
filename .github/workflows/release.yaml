      # In order to share the built artifacts in the subsequent tests, we use cache instead of actions/upload-artifacts.

      # find the artifacts uploaded here. See https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/21 for more context.
      # Downside of this is that, we pressure the cache capacity set per repository. We delete all caches created
      # on PRs on close. See .github/workflows/clear_cache.yaml. On main branch, in any way this cache will be deleted
      # in 7 days, also this at most a few MB, so this won't be an issue.
