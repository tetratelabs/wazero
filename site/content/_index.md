**WebAssembly** is a way to safely run code compiled in other languages. Runtimes
execute WebAssembly Modules (Wasm), which are most often binaries with a
`.wasm` extension.

**wazero** is the only zero dependency WebAssembly runtime written in Go.

## Get Started



**Get the wazero CLI** and run any Wasm binary

```bash
$ curl https://wazero.io/install.sh | sh
$ ./bin/wazero run app.wasm
```

**Embed wazero** in your Go project and extend any app

```go
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
mod, _ := r.Instantiate(ctx, wasmAdd)
res, _ := mod.ExportedFunction("add").Call(ctx, 1, 2)
```

## Example

The best way to learn wazero is by trying one of our [examples][1]. The
most [basic example][2] extends a Go application with an addition function
defined in WebAssembly.

## Why zero?

By avoiding CGO, wazero avoids prerequisites such as shared libraries or libc,
and lets you keep features like cross compilation. Being pure Go, wazero adds
only a small amount of size to your binary. Meanwhile, wazeroâ€™s API gives
features you expect in Go, such as safe concurrency and context propagation.

### When can I use this?

wazero is an early project, so APIs are subject to change until version 1.0.
To use wazero meanwhile, you need to use the latest pre-release like this:

```bash
go get github.com/tetratelabs/wazero@latest
```

wazero will tag a new pre-release at least once a month until 1.0. 1.0 is
scheduled for March 2023 and will require minimally Go 1.18. Except
experimental packages, wazero will not break API on subsequent minor versions.

Meanwhile, please practice the current APIs to ensure they work for you, and
give us a [star][3] if you are enjoying it so far!
