WebAssembly is a way to safely run code compiled in other languages. Runtimes
execute WebAssembly Modules (Wasm), which are most often binaries with a
`.wasm` extension.

wazero is the only zero dependency WebAssembly runtime written in Go.

## Example

The best way to learn wazero is by trying one of our [examples][1]. The
most [basic example][2] extends a Go application with an addition function
defined in WebAssembly.

## Why zero?

By avoiding CGO, wazero avoids prerequisites such as shared libraries or libc,
and lets you keep features like cross compilation. Being pure Go, wazero adds
only a small amount of size to your binary. Meanwhile, wazeroâ€™s API gives
features you expect in Go, such as safe concurrency and context propagation.

### When can I use this?

wazero is an early project, so APIs are subject to change until version 1.0.
To use wazero meanwhile, you need to use the latest pre-release like this:

```bash
go get github.com/tetratelabs/wazero@latest
```

wazero will tag a new pre-release at least once a month until 1.0. 1.0 is
scheduled for Feb 2023, following the release of Go 1.20.

Meanwhile, please practice the current APIs to ensure they work for you, and
give us a [star][3] if you are enjoying it so far!
