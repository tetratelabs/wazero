**WebAssembly** is a way to safely run code compiled in other languages. Runtimes
execute WebAssembly Modules (Wasm), which are most often binaries with a
`.wasm` extension.

**wazero** is the only zero dependency WebAssembly runtime written in Go.

## Get Started

**Get the wazero CLI** and run any Wasm binary

```bash
curl https://wazero.io/install.sh | sh
./bin/wazero run app.wasm
```

**Embed wazero** in your Go project and extend any app

```go
import "github.com/tetratelabs/wazero"

// ...

r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
mod, _ := r.Instantiate(ctx, wasmAdd)
res, _ := mod.ExportedFunction("add").Call(ctx, 1, 2)
```

## Example

The best way to learn wazero is by trying one of our [examples][1]. The
most [basic example][2] extends a Go application with an addition function
defined in WebAssembly.

## Why zero?

By avoiding CGO, wazero avoids prerequisites such as shared libraries or libc,
and lets you keep features like cross compilation. Being pure Go, wazero adds
only a small amount of size to your binary. Meanwhile, wazeroâ€™s API gives
features you expect in Go, such as safe concurrency and context propagation.

### When can I use this?

You can use wazero today! wazero's [1.0 release][3] happened in March 2023, and
is [in use]({{< relref "/community/users.md" >}}) by many projects and
production sites.

You can get the latest version of wazero like this.
```bash
go get github.com/tetratelabs/wazero@latest
```

Please give us a [star][4] if you end up using wazero!
