// # Notes
//
//   - This is not yet implemented by default, so you will need to use
//     wazero.NewRuntimeConfigInterpreter
//   - The instruction list is too long to enumerate in godoc.
//     See https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/blob/main/proposals/threads/Overview.md
//   - Atomic operations are guest-only until api.Memory or otherwise expose them to host functions.
